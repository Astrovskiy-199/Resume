The costume itself is equipped with a video camera and cooling, but nevertheless, the costume weighs 45 kilograms, and the temperature inside reaches 40 degrees, so it’s almost impossible to control it without preparation. Fortunately, I had experience managing and testing this costume, thanks to Aetsoft, which actually provided this costume for the event   </p>

After all, during the course, everyone wins, both students, the teacher and the company. The advantage of a teacher is that he gets valuable experience mentoring Junior employees and repeats already forgotten theory in places. For students, the advantage is the opportunity to get a first job and get basic knowledge in the field of testing, and the company is guaranteed to get the most motivated and interested Junior employees who have already met the company during the course. To my surprise, the next day a meeting was organized about the course, where the goals and objectives were discussed, and then it was decided to organize recruitment for the course. As a result of completing the course, two Junior testers received job offers.</p>

                <p class="DescriptionText"> One of the main tasks during the courses was to minimize stressful situations and competition between students, and also to create maximum mutual assistance and teamwork.

An example of one of the competitive classes is a speed testing competition, the task itself can be viewed at <a href="./turbo_testing/index.html">link</a>  </p>

Initially, I was a content Manager at this company and did minimal site layout, but then a fairly serious project appeared that required QA. I was offered to try this profession, as a result of which I agreed. We agreed that I would spend two months learning the basics of testing and development, and then the development team would conduct an interview, the results of which would suggest that I stay or leave the company. During the two months of preparation, I read the main books on testing, studied the most relevant tools, and successfully passed the interview. That's when my QA journey started. The company had mainly blockchain projects and testing was based on them. For the most part, I tested API services and frontend, but sometimes I had to fix some minor bugs myself.    </p>

                The roads that we walk every day become automatic. We mechanically hurry, thinking about something else, oblivious of the scenery, no beauty, no people around, in such moments, you want to do nothing and just sit home and play Xbox, or read a book. There is nothing wrong or terrible in this, if we at least sometimes make some variety. It is diversity that helps to motivate, generate new thoughts, and achieve goals. If possible, I try to make sure that every day brings something new: I can change the route to work, buy some unusual dinner in the store. In more global things, I can learn something new, take online courses, skydive or go somewhere Hiking. At one of these times, I took a hunter's course, where I passed an exam and got a license and permission to hunt, but I never used it:)
